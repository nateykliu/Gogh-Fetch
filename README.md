This frontend project was designed as part of my Galvanize Course. It uses the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) Collection API to display (sort of) random art. Features include a button to fetch random artwork, search function :mag:, dark mode :first_quarter_moon:, music :musical_keyboard:, gallery features, and the ability to filter artwork by type. Thanks for reading!


Resources Used:
JQuery Library, MET API (https://metmuseum.github.io/)
