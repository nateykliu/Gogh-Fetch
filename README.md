# Frontend

Hey there, welcome to Gogh Fetch! :paintbrush:

This frontend project was designed as part of my Galvanize Course. It uses the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) Collection API to display (sort of) random art. Features include a button to fetch random artwork, search function :mag:, dark mode :first_quarter_moon:, music :musical_keyboard:, gallery features, and the ability to filter artwork by type. 

Each click is a new surprise - thanks for reading, and have fun discovering new art! :framed_picture:
