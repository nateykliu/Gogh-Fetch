# Frontend

Welcome to Gogh Fetch!

This frontend project was designed as part of my Galvanize Course. It uses the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) Collection API to display random art. Features include a button to fetch another random artwork, search function, dark mode, music, gallery features, and the ability to filter artwork by type. Thanks for reading!


Resources Used:
JQuery Library, MET API (https://metmuseum.github.io/)
